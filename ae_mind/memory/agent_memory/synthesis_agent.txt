To create a comprehensive research plan for identifying the top 10 players with the highest Elo ratings, we need to address several key aspects of your research. Hereâ€™s a structured approach based on your questions:

### 1. Specific Game or Platform
- **Focus:** Determine which game or platform you are interested in. This could be chess, League of Legends, Dota 2, or another competitive game that uses the Elo rating system. Each game has its own community, data sources, and ranking systems, so specifying the game will help narrow down the research scope.

### 2. Historical vs. Current Data
- **Data Type:** Decide whether you want to focus on historical data, current statistics, or both. Historical data can provide insights into the evolution of player rankings over time, while current data can help identify the top players at present.

### 3. Research Purpose
- **Objective:** Clearly define the main goal of your research. Are you looking to:
  - Analyze the evolution of Elo scores over time?
  - Compare players across different platforms or games?
  - Understand the factors contributing to high Elo ratings?
  - Identify trends or patterns in player performance?

### 4. Additional Information
- **Specific Aspects:** Consider any other specific aspects you want to include, such as:
  - Regional differences in player rankings.
  - The impact of major tournaments or events on Elo ratings.
  - The role of team dynamics in games like League of Legends or Dota 2.

### Research Plan Outline

#### Introduction and Research Goals
