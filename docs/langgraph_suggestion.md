# LangGraph Integration Suggestion

This repository currently orchestrates ministers via direct method calls.
For complex workflows, consider adopting **LangGraph** to model
reflection→planning→action loops as a directed graph.
Each minister can be represented as a node, and adaptive directives become
task edges controlled by the Premier. This would enable flexible
reconfiguration of agent interactions without changing their internal logic.
